Before testing intelligence, we need to define it

I argue that humans do not have a clear definition for intelligence. It has many parts, this we surely know but the full scope of it? To find something without knowing what you are looking for is impossible.

We might have definitions for what a word should mean in order to generally help consolidate communication and knowledge sharing. Not only among people but also with animals or even technology. (Think how you utter your dog to “sit” and your home-assistant “hello” to wake them up.)

Essentially, we are labelling an idea or as Plato called it the Form with conditioned and qualified characteristics of the Form. We are mimicking the underlying idea and try to convey it as closely as possible to what we think it should be in order to transfer the meaning or the accompanying emotion.

Where using language to distinguish between abundance of food and mortal danger is sufficient, it might not be the best measure for intelligence, let alone creating mutual understanding about complex ideas and emotions like love, compassion or intelligence.

If we do not look beyond our symbolic abstractions of the world around and in us, we are just seeing the shadows of the real thing, being cast on the wall of the cave by the sun outside. As Plato believed - true knowledge and intelligence is the ability to grasp the world of Forms with one's mind. We are likely to test such ability in mechanisms when we understand how we come to understand those Forms and not only the representations of them.
